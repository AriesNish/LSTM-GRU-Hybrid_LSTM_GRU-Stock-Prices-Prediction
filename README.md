LSTM-GRU Hybrid for Stock Price Prediction
Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of a hybrid model combining both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks for predicting stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock price data and aims to provide accurate short-term predictions.

Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging and important task in the financial domain. This repository demonstrates the use of a hybrid LSTM-GRU model to forecast stock prices. LSTM and GRU are popular types of recurrent neural networks known for their ability to capture sequential dependencies in data.
